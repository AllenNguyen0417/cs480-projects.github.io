	<h3>What is CPPickup?</h3>
	We all can agree, parking at CPP is really bad. So this is a solution for
	that. With the help of Esri map technology, you now can be a part of the 
	solution that will let Cal Poly Pomona Students facilitate fixing the horrendous
	parking situation. This is amazing since there are no plans as of right now
	to expand the parking for students.
